# Dummy BlockChain by PhanKiet
### Introduction
I saw a video on Youtube about building a virtual currency so I decided to do it by Python (cause it's easy and time-saving)

### Version
v1.0: haven't implemented POW<br>
v2.0: implemented POW. Haven't distributed the record of the blockchain to everyone in the network (cause I don't even have one *shame*)
